Connect your Pico to the PC while pressing BOOT and drop the uf2 file into the folder that appears. That's all !
- the "one folder per boot" is the regular version (1024 files per folder, one folder per boot)
- the "100 files per folder" mimicks the folder numbering of the BitBoy (folder number does not increment at boot)
