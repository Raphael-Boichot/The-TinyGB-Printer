# A board to rule them all !
- Drop **TinyGB_Printer.ino.uf2** and print. Your images are on SD card ready to be publisehd to social media, magic !
- Drop **GameBoyPrinterEmulator.ino.uf2** and you board will work as an [Arduino Game Boy Printer emulator](https://github.com/mofosyne/arduino-gameboy-printer-emulator). The [Android Camera Manager](https://github.com/Mraulio/GBCamera-Android-Manager) is by far the best device to enjoy all the project capabilities.
 - Drop **Pico_gb_printer.uf2** and you board will work as an [Pico GB Printer](https://github.com/untoxa/pico-gb-printer). This build have been compiled to be pinout compatible (the RGB led won't flash as it requires a dedicated library not included in the original project but everything else works).
