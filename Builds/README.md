Connect your Pico to the PC while pressing BOOT and drop the uf2 file into the folder that appears. That's all !
- the "one folder per boot" is the regular version (1024 files per folder, one folder per boot)
- the "100 files per folder" mimicks the folder numbering of the BitBoy (folder number does not increment at boot)
- The "pico-gb-printer" version allows you to play with [this project](https://github.com/untoxa/pico-gb-printer). Connect the board to a PC and get your images directly from the [dedicated web interface](http://192.168.7.1/).
