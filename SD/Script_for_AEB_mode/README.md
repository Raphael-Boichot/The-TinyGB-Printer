## Some script to create High Dynamic Range pictures (requires a PC)

This is a [GNU Octave script](https://octave.org/) to to create High Dynamic Range picture. GNU Octave is a programming platform / langage for scientific computing, it can be used whatever your prefered OS.

Just drop some images taken at different exposures (like with AEB mode in Photo!) in the current folder, run the **AEB_mode_for_Photo.m** script and enjoy your enhanced image !

You can also upload your images to the [GBCamera Android Manager](https://github.com/Mraulio/GBCamera-Android-Manager) and apply the exact same process.
