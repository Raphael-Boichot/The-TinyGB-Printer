## Some script to simulate thermal paper (requires a PC)

This is a [GNU Octave script](https://octave.org/) to simulate a thermal paper output. GNU Octave is a programming platform / langage for scientific computing, it can be used whatever your prefered OS.

Just drop some images in the **/Image_in** folder, run **Thermal_paper_emulator.m** script and enjoy you images freshly baked in **/Paper_out** folder. You can of course play with the [parameters](https://github.com/Raphael-Boichot/The-TinyGB-Printer/blob/11cf0198a5f711a38a46dcad767c037ce5f8676b/SD/Paper_emulator/Thermal_paper_emulator.m#L9) to modify paper hue and printing intensity.

You can also upload your images to the [GBCamera Android Manager](https://github.com/Mraulio/GBCamera-Android-Manager) and apply the exact same filter.
