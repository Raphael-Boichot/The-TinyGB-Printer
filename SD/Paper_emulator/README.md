## Some Toy script to simulate thermal paper

This is a [GNU Octave script](https://octave.org/) to simulate a thermal paper output. Just place your images in **/Image_in** folder, run **The_Fake_Printer.m** script and enjoy you images converted in **/Paper_out** folder. You can play with the [parameters](https://github.com/Raphael-Boichot/The-TinyGB-Printer/blob/7eb4d7c1e2a45b5d8f762ec9807d3feabd0829df/SD/Paper_emulator/The_Fake_Printer.m#L12) to modify paper color and printing intensity.
