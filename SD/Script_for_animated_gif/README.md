## Some Python script to create animated gif

This is a Python script to to create animated gifs (not myself a huge fan of Python, so this is a ChatGPT generated script). Any online tool should do the job too.

Just drop some images taken at different times in the /Pictures folder, run the code script and enjoy your animation !

You can also upload your images to the [GBCamera Android Manager](https://github.com/Mraulio/GBCamera-Android-Manager) and apply the exact same process.
